# Hass.io Add-on: Xbox One

Xbox One support for Home Assistant

## About

This add-on is a packaged version of the [Xbox One SmartGlass RESTful server](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-rest-python) and a Home Assistant [Xbox One custom component](https://github.com/tuxuser/home-assistant-xboxone).  It allows you to easily setup and configure controlling your Xbox from Home Assistant.

1. Put your Xbox Live account details into the `email`/`password` options.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your credentials.
1. Start the "Xbox One" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Xbox One" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Surf to your Hass.io instance and use port `5557`
    (e.g. `http://hassio.local:5557`).
